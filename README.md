## Introduction

This project aims to consume the Pokémon REST API (PokéApi), using the C# language. The ultimate goal is to allow the user to choose a Pokémon to have as a pet, similar to a tamagotchi.

The PokéApi provides a wide range of information about Pokémon, such as their name, abilities, stats, types, and more. Through this API, our program will be able to obtain a list of Pokémon and display it to the user, allowing him to choose one of them to become his virtual pet.

When selecting a Pokémon, the user will be able to interact with its virtual pet. This interaction will be implemented using the resources of the C# language.

We hope this project will provide a fun and interactive experience for Pokémon fans, allowing them to relive the excitement of having a virtual pet.
